title: Check Box
layout: component

<p class="lead">A component responsible for instant "selection" feedback. </p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-6">

<h3>Typical Appearance</h3>

<blockquote>Across nearly all platforms, check boxes are virtually identical. This component's simplicity prevents it from having a wide variety of designs. </blockquote>

<h3>Typical Behavior</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>This component has only two possible behaviors across platforms: checked or unchecked. Like a button, these different states should be obvious in the event that someone clicks on it. </p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Events</h4>

<blockquote>Like a button can be clicked or unclicked, a check box checked or unchecked. Additionally, check boxes represent the event of an item in a list. A simple example of this representation is a to-do list; and whether a certain task has been "to-done". </blockquote>

<h4>State Diagram</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>The following diagram shows a list of text messages and indication whether their indicated check boxes are selected or unselected. </p>

<p> The standard check box indicates it's behavior with a &#10003 symbol inside a specific shape or an empty shape. In this diagram, the shape is a circle but check boxes can also be indicated in any other empty shape; most standard being square. Check boxes also indicate their behavior with color shading in the shape. In the state diagram, the check boxes are shaded blue when checked. </p>

<h4>Component in Action</h4>

<h3>Variants</h3>
<img src="screenshots/IMG_1545.jpg" style="width:270px;height:278px;">
<blockquote>There is almost never just one form of a user interface component. Use this section to address variations
  on this theme. Some variations are sufficiently different that they are considered to be a different component
  entirely, despite very similar behavior. Meanwile some variations are due to appearance only.</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><em>Menu items</em> are very close to buttons in behavior—they perform individual action elements upon simple
    invocation by a user. However, they belong to a broader context/structure of a menu, and look sufficiently
    different that they are both conceptually and programmatically viewed as distinct from buttons.</li>

  <li><em>Links</em> can be considered as a specialized button—they are invoked almost identically, and their action
    is even more narrowly defined as moving the user to a different view or display. The distinction here is
    definitely less sharp than the distinction between a menu item and a button. For links within a document, the
    document might be viewed as a menu in itself, and thus links are “menu items” indicating what the user can view
    next. Thus, in some ways, links are hybrids between buttons and menu items.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Priority Metrics</h3>

<blockquote>Talk about the five usability metrics in relation to this component. Not all components will have the same
  metric priorities. For example:</blockquote>

<p>Because the button is such a fundamental part of virtually every user interface available today, it can be said that
  all usability metrics are equally important for this component. Users who are seeing a button in a given platform for
  the first time must not have any issues recognizing it and knowing what to do with it (learnability). The high
  priority of learnability also implies that memorability is a given.</p>

<p>Users must also never experience undue delays with using a button (efficiency), particularly because using a button
  almost always involves an instantaneous, immediate-result action. Users should almost never trigger a button by
  mistake (errors)—especially buttons whose actions result in significant changes to data or the real world.</p>

<p>If any metric at all can be considered as a “low priority” for buttons, it would be satisfaction. The button is such
  a utilitarian component that “fun” or “enjoyment” is hardly associated with its use. One exception to this
  prioritization may be for buttons in applications whose primary metric is satisfaction (e.g., games, entertainment).
  As a part of that overall system, making buttons “fun” may then become more important than in other situations.</p>

<h3>Key Characteristics</h3>

<blockquote>This section is for describing “what makes for a good <em>your component here</em>?”
  Most likely, this is an amalgam of guidelines documents and platform-independent interaction design
  principles.</blockquote>
